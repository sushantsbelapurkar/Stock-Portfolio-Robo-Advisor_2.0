Advanced Stock-Portfolio-Robo-Advisor project, enhancing the  [initial version](https://github.com/sushantsbelapurkar/Stock-Portfolio-Robo-Advisor) with a focus on in-depth analysis of 30 years of stock data. Designed portfolios based on three strategies: Fundamental Analysis, Value Analysis, and Growth Analysis, guided by Benjamin Graham's and Peter Lynch's investment principles.
The project employs advanced Data Modeling and data warehousing concepts for data storage and analysis. It fetches results for each company for the last five years and historical prices for 30 years from an API, constructing a robust data warehouse. This enables analysis from various perspectives using different algorithmic logics, implemented with advanced SQL and Python.

Furthermore, the portfolio is now managed automatically using Airflow DAG, where stopred procedures are executed sequentially to run the entire analysis.
